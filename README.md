#Rivals Football Player Scraper

This Python project scrapes football player data (names and profile URLs) from Rivals.com using Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and direct requests as a backup. It is designed to work in environments like Google Colab, where installing Chrome and ChromeDriver may require custom setup.
